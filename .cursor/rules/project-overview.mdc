# Ace Of Spades Library Reverse Engineering Project

## Project Purpose
This project aims to reverse engineer Ace Of Spades 1.x libraries, specifically focusing on packets and server logic with the goal of remaking a server for the game.

## Project Structure
- **aosdump/**: Contains the existing compiled binary (original implementation)
  - **aoslib/**: Original game library implementation
  - **shared/**: Original shared components
- **aoslib/**: Our new implementation of the game library
- **shared/**: Our new implementation of shared components
- **build/**: Compiled versions of our new implementation
- [test_packets.py](mdc:test_packets.py): Test script that compares original vs new implementation

## Testing Methodology
The project uses a dual-testing approach to validate packet implementations:
1. Python 2: `py2 ./test_packets.py` - Tests against the original implementation
2. Python 3: `py ./test_packets.py` - Tests against our new implementation

The test script automatically adjusts paths based on Python version to test the appropriate implementation.

## Key Components
- **Packets**: The [test_packets.py](mdc:test_packets.py) file contains implementations of various packet types used in the game
- **ByteWriter/ByteReader**: Utility classes for serializing/deserializing packet data
- Each packet test function creates a packet with test values, serializes it, then deserializes it to verify correctness
